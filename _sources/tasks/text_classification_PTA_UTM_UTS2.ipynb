Kemudian aplikasi ini akan menerimarespon dari server dan melakukan proses enkripsi pada dokumen HTMLterlebih dahulu. Sehingga dokumen HTML yang dikirim kepada webclient sudah berbentuk dokumen HTML yang terenkripsi. Web clientdisini bisa berupa aplikasi seperti Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox,atau Opera. Aplikasi-aplikasi tersebut biasa dikenal dengan sebutan webbrowser.Ketika web browser menerima dokumen HTML yang terenkripsidari aplikasi proxy server, maka JavaScript Engine yang ada di webbrowser akan melakukan proses dekripsi sekaligus rendering sehinggadokumen akan ditampilkan sesuai dengan aslinya.

Komunikasi data yang diimplementasikan juga beragam, teks, gambar bahkan suara. Medium yang digunakan-pun kini beragam baik itu internet, local connection hingga bluetooth. Bluetooth dapat dipilih sebagai alternatif medium untuk menghubungkan satu perangkat dengan perangkat lain. Ditambah lagi dengan perkembangan android yang belakangan ini juga semakin pesat semakin memberi kemudahan untuk betukar data melalui bluetooth. Bluetooth mampu menghubungkan perangkat yang satu dengan perangkat lainnya. Ini kemudian memungkinkan antar perangkat dapat saling bertukar atau berkirim data. Namun, dalam proses pengiriman data tersebut tidak ada yang dapat menjamin keamanannya. Hal ini yang kemudian membuat proses enkripsi menjadi hal yang penting. Data yang dikirim terlebih dahulu dikodekan sedemikian rupa hingga hanya dengan kunci tertentu kode tersebut dapat dibaca. RSA kemudian muncul sebagai salah satu alternatif algoritma yang dapat digunakan menangani proses enkripsi tersebut. RSA memiliki teknik pemfaktoran yang cukup rumit, hal ini membuat tingkat keamanannya cukup tinggi. Selain itu, RSA juga cocok diaplikasikan dalam platform mobile karena memiliki struktur yang asimetris sehingga tidak terlalu membebani sistem yang dimiliki oleh perangkat mobile tersebut.

Saat ini tren memperoleh informasi melalui situs berita online semakin populer. Kebanyakan pembaca ingin memperoleh informasi dari sebuah berita dengan cepat, ringkas dan tidak banyak membuang waktu. Tujuan penelitian ini untuk memberikan kemudahan bagi pembaca untuk mendapatkan informasi terpenting dari suatu berita dengan cepat.Pada penelitian ini, dibangun sebuah aplikasi peringkas berita online otomatis yang dikembangkan menggunakan metode perhitungan Ordinary Weighting. Metode Ordinary Weighting merupakan perhitungan bobot term berdasarkan prinsip TF * IDF dengan menggunakan TF tanpa normalisasi. Tujuan aplikasi ini untuk menghasilkan sebuah ringkasan yang terdiri dari tiga kalimat dengan nilai bobot tertinggi sebagai ringkasan dari suatu artikel berita dengan tetap mempertahankan ide utama dari berita tersebut. Proses evaluasi dilakukan dengan cara membandingkan hasil ringkasan yang dihasilkan oleh sistem dengan ringkasan yang dibuat secara manual oleh koresponden melalui metode kuesioner, dengan prinsip Majority Opinion.Dari hasil penelitian diketahui bahwa kesesuaian hasil ringkasan sistem dengan pengguna yang diperoleh dari kuesioner menunjukkan hasil nilai rata-rata recall sebesar 0.47, precision 0.40 dan rata-rata f-measures sebesar 0.53.\",\n","    \"Perintah dengan menggunakan suara memungkinkan penggunadapat mengakses isi database dengan mengucapkan perintah melaluiperalatan masukan audio tanpa harus menggunakan cara konvensional.Penggunaan program database dalam pengoperasiannya, diperlukanpemahaman pada struktur SQL (Structured Query Language).Kemudahan bisa dirasakan bagi pengguna awam karena sistempengaksesan database disertai dengan pengembangan NLP (NaturalLanguage Processing).Perintah dengan suara menggunakan piranti masukan audioseperti mikrofon dan mesin pengenal ucapan.
